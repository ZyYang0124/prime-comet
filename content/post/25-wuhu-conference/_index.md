HBUARA Lab achieved a historic breakthrough at the 18th Chinese Arachnology Symposium.

<!--more-->

The 18th Chinese Society of Zoological Arachnology Symposium was successfully held from October 11 to 12, 2025, at Anhui Normal University in Wuhu, Anhui Province. Hosted by the Arachnology Committee of the Chinese Society of Zoological, the conference brought together over one hundred experts, scholars, and researchers from universities and research institutions across China. The event featured in-depth discussions on cutting-edge topics in arachnology, including taxonomy, systematics, ecological behavior, neurobiology, and acarology.

During the oral presentation session, postdoctoral researcher Zhaoyi Li, doctoral students Zhiyong Yang, Wenlong Fan, and master’s students Yi Ni, Yiting Xu and Siqi Liu delivered presentations titled "Phylogeny of the Salticid Tribe Euophryini and the Coevolution of Male and Female Genitalia", "Unveiling the Classification of Chinese Chrysilline Jumping Spiders: Integrative Insights from Molecular and Morphological Evidence", "Taxonomic Studies on Solifugae in China", "New Insights into the Taxonomy of the Genus *Synageles* (Araneae: Salticidae) Based on UCE and Morphological Data", "Taxonomic Studies on Palpigradi (Arachnida: Pedipalpi) in China", and "Spider Species Diversity in the Saihanwula Nature Reserve", respectively. Covering diverse research areas such as new taxonomic discoveries, molecular phylogenetics, evolutionary relationships of specialized groups, and regional biodiversity surveys, the presentations were well-received and sparked extensive discussion among attendees.
