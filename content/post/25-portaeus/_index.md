A breakthrough phylogenomic study has deciphered a long-standing enigma within the highly diverse jumping spiders (Salticidae). The paper titled “Phylogenomic placement of a new genus and species of jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae: Spartaeini) based on UCE data” has recently been published in the journal Invertebrate Systematics.

Abstract: Recent phylogenomic studies have established a robust backbone relationship for the seven sub families of jumping spiders (Salticidae), and identified an enigmatic clade within the subtribe Spartaeina, a major lineage of the subfamily Spartaeinae. However, the classification of this enigmatic clade remained unresolved due to the availability of only one male specimen at that time. In this study, we extensively examined additional materials and obtained ultraconserved element (UCE) data for more putative species of this lineage. The UCE phylogenetic results provided a comprehensive and strongly supported framework for the subtribe Spartaeina, and confirmed that the enigmatic clade is a distinct lineage, separate from genera with similar morphological traits. Coupled with morphological evidence, we describe a new genus, *Protaeus* gen. nov., and three new species: *Protaeus nyarlathotep* sp. nov., *P. dracosquamus* sp. nov., and *P. gulliwingus* sp. nov. We also revise the classification of three previously misplaced species into this new genus: *P. jianfeng* (Song & Zhu, 1998) comb. nov. (transferred from Portia), *P. forcipiformis* (Yang, Liu, Liu & Peng, 2017) comb. nov. (transferred from Spartaeus) and *P. shiwandashan* (Wang, Mi, Li & Xu, 2024) comb. nov. (transferred from Mintonia). Additionally, we redescribe the male of *P. jianfeng* and provide a description of the female for the first time. This study enhances our understanding of evolutionary relationships within Spartaeina and underscores the importance of further exploration within this diverse group.
