title: "New Whip Spider Species Discovered in Guangdong"
subtitle: ""
summary: "We have discovered and described a new species of whip spider, *Sarax quinquespinus* sp. nov., from rock crevices in Yuexiu Park, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. This species is uniquely characterized by five dorsal and five ventral spines on the femur of its walking legs. It is the third *Sarax* species recorded in China and the first from Guangdong. The discovery significantly enriches China’s whip spider diversity and fills a long-standing geographic gap in the genus’s known distribution between Yunnan and Fujian provinces, pointing to a potentially distinct East Asian evolutionary lineage."

#### **Abstract:** 

A new species of the whip spider genus *Sarax* Simon, 1892 collected from Guangdong Province, China is diagnosed and 
described based on morphological characters: *Sarax quinquespinus* sp. nov. (♂♀). With this third *Sarax* species recorded 
in China, the geographical gap in its distribution between Yunnan to Fujian is filled. In addition, a distribution map and 
the photos of living male and female, copulatory organs and other structures are provided.
