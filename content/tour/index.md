          Jumping spiders (Salticidae) represent the most species-rich family of spiders, providing an exceptional framework for exploring evolutionary and biomimetic questions. Known for their explosive diversification, remarkable morphological diversity, and complex behaviors, these miniature marvels are key to addressing fundamental issues in systematics, adaptive radiation, and functional innovation.
        
          We integrate systematics, phylogenomics, comparative and functional morphology, and evolutionary genomics, to illuminate the rich diversity and unravel the patterns of diversification and adaptive evolution within this extraordinary group of spiders.
