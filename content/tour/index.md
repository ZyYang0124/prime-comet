          Jumping spiders (Salticidae) represent the most species-rich family of spiders, providing an exceptional framework for exploring evolutionary and biomimetic questions. Known for their explosive diversification, remarkable morphological diversity, and complex behaviors, these miniature marvels are key to addressing fundamental issues in systematics, adaptive radiation, and functional innovation.
        
          We integrate systematics, phylogenomics, comparative and functional morphology, and evolutionary genomics, to illuminate the rich diversity and unravel the patterns of diversification and adaptive evolution within this extraordinary group of spiders.

          The RTA Spiders </br>
          <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; opacity: 0.9;">A Macroevolutionary Model of Unparalleled Diversity</span>
        content: |
        
          The RTA clade, named for the Retrolateral Tibial Apophysis on the male palp, represents the most extensive evolutionary radiation in spider history. Encompassing 52 families, 2,204 genera, and approximately 26,000 species, this lineage alone comprises over half of all known spider diversity, making it a quintessential model for investigating macroevolutionary dynamics, ecological adaptation, and phylogenetic relationships.
        
          We integrate phylogenomics, comparative morphology, and behavioral ecology to address three primary objectives:
          1. Reconstruct the deep evolutionary history of this megadiverse lineage. 
          
          2. Estimate divergence times and analyze diversification patterns. 
          
          3. Elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms—from key morphological innovations to complex behaviors—underpinning its extraordinary success.

        content: |
        
          Mygalomorphae is one of the major lineages of spiders, encompassing over 30 families and 3,000 species. Their fastidious selection of microhabitats and conservative, long-lived life history traits make them excellent models for studies of evolution, biogeography, and species delimitation. Among them, tarantulas (Theraphosidae) are the most diverse group and are renowned for their furry appearance and large size.

          We focus on the taxonomy, species delimitation, population genetics, and evolution of Chinese Crassitarsae (including Theraphosidae and Nemesiidae) and integrate morphological data, high-throughput sequencing data, and machine learning methods to address these issues.

          Gentle Hunters in Hidden Corners </br>

          Pseudoscorpions, often called "false scorpions," look like miniature scorpions but do not have a long tail. They generally move slowly, but can quickly back away when threatened. These small creatures live mostly in hidden habitats—such as leaf litter, under tree bark, beneath stones, or even in caves—where they prey on other tiny arthropods like springtails and mites. Pseudoscorpions are highly diverse in species. Yet, due to their small size and secretive lifestyles, many species have yet to be discovered and formally described.

          Our goal is to carry out taxonomic studies on pseudoscorpions found in China. We seek to uncover the diversity within this group and to explore how their species formed, the evolutionary paths they have taken, and the reasons behind their current distribution patterns.

          Solifugae, commonly known as sun spiders, wind scorpions, or camel spiders, are widely distributed in arid and semi-arid regions from tropical to temperate zones. Renowned for their large chelicerae, remarkable running speed, and fierce predatory behavior, they are a group of arachnids with rich species diversity, distinctive morphology, and high biological significance. 

          We are dedicated to the study of Solifugae in the fields of taxonomy, phylogenetics, and genomics, integrating morphological and molecular approaches to elucidate their species diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and mechanisms of adaptive evolution.

          Whip scorpions (Uropygi) are a group of arachnids with unique defensive mechanisms. They belong to the Pedipalpi, just like whip spiders, and are known for their elongated first pair of legs, specialized pedipalps, flagellum at the end of the abdomen, and defensive acid-spraying behavior. These creatures are useful models for studying the defensive adaptations, evolution, and ecological niches of arachnids. 

          By integrating methods such as morphological characteristics, paleontological evidence, and molecular phylogenetics, we are committed to unraveling the biodiversity and evolution of this group.

        id: bianzhu

          Whip spiders (Amblypygi) are members of the Pedipalpi within the class Arachnida. Their distinctive features include extremely elongated first pair of legs and highly specialized pedipalps. 

          Due to their ancient and unique taxonomic status, these creatures are valuable models for studying the evolution of arachnids. We integrate the use of morphology, ecology, and molecular systematics, aiming to unravel the survival wisdom of these mysterious organisms throughout their evolutionary history.
