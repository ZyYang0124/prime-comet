My research encompasses a diverse range of fields, including systematics, phylogenomics, biodiversity discovery and monitoring, historical biogeography, and evolutionary biology.

By employing modern phylogenomic techniques and morphological tools, I strive to unravel the biodiversity and evolutionary narratives of captivating creatures such as arachnids—with a special focus on the charismatic jumping spiders (Salticidae)—as well as intriguing insect groups like assassin bugs, wasps, and ants.
