My master’s thesis focused on the taxonomy and phylogeny of cheiracanthiids, a group of slender-bodied, light-colored spiders. His doctoral research centered on the phylogenetics and evolutionary diversification of RTA spiders.

My current work focuses on the taxonomy and phylogenetic studies of the clubionid spiders.
