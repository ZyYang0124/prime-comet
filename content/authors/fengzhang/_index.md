My research is centered on the taxonomy, phylogeny, and mechanisms of speciation in arachnids, encompassing a wide range of orders including Araneae, Pseudoscorpiones, Opiliones, Scorpiones, Palpigradi, Solifugae, Thelyphonida, and Amblypygi. To date, I have described more than 700 new species and established 16 new genera, significantly contributing to the understanding of arachnid biodiversity and evolutionary relationships.

I have led 15 research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Ministry of Science and Technology, along with 8 provincial or ministerial-level grants. My scholarly output includes over 300 scientific papers, nearly 200 of which are indexed in SCI journals, and three authoritative academic monographs, reflecting sustained contributions to arachnological science.
