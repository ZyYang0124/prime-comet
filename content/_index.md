        Our lab is dedicated to the **integrative study of Arachnida**, with a primary focus on spiders. We combine approaches from morphological taxonomy, molecular phylogenetics, trait evolution, and comparative genomics to unravel the diversity, evolutionary history, and adaptive innovations of arachnids. By bridging classical systematics with modern genomic tools, we aim to address fundamental questions in biodiversity, adaptation, and evolutionary biology.
